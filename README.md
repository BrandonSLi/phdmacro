This is the course page of PhD level advanced macroeconomics. I will update this website every week during the course. You can download the materials by clicking the link.

**[Problem Set 1](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/PS1.pdf)**, Due date: 2020.10.21

1. 9.29. We introduced the [syllabus](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/syllabus.pdf) of this course and learned some prerequisites of modern macroeconomics. Please download the lecture notes of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/chapter%201.pdf). In this lecture, we learned why to take logarithm to the time series data and studied how to build the **Hodrick-Prescott filter**. We introduced the representative consumer's problem and related preference, utility function, indifference curve, marginal rate of substitution. We learned why the conditions that the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function are zero are neccesary to the optimal solution of the optimization problem with equality constraint. You should also learn how to do comparative statics with **implicit function theorem**. Additionally, we proved the **envelope theorem** and its economic intuition. [Problem Set 1](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/PS1.pdf) is posted.

2. 10.06. We introduced the representative firm's problem, and the definition of **competitive equilibrium**, during which we learned **Walras Law**. We applied the implicit function theorem to study how we conduct comparative statics to the equilibrium characterization equations. Then we learned **Pareto optimum** and showed two **fundamental theorems of welfare economics** under some conditions. Please read Chapter 4 and 5 of Williamson (2018) to get more economic intution. You can also watch the recorded videos on bilibili: [part 1](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1q54y117Rx), [part 2](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ky4y1k7eq), [part 3](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1vi4y1E7E2).

3. 10.13. We learned the two-period model with consumption-saving tradeoff. We showed the competative equilibrium and social optimum of this model. You should know what the key consumption-tradeoff is, namely what the Euler equation bears and what the **Ricardian equivalence** is.

4. 10.20. Please download the lecture notes of [Chapter 2](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/chapter%202.pdf). [Answer of Problem Set 1](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/PS1%20answer.pdf) is posted.
