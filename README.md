1. 9.29. We introduced the [syllabus](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/syllabus.pdf) of this course and learned some prerequisites of modern macroeconomics. Please download the lecture notes of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/binwangwork/phdmacro/blob/gh/chapter%201.pdf). In this lecture, we learned why to take logarithm to the time series data and studied how to build the **Hodrick-Prescott filter**. We introduced the representative consumer's problem and related preference, utility function, indifference curve, marginal rate of substitution. We learned why the conditions that the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian function are zero are neccesary to the optimal solution of the optimization problem with equality constraint. You should also learn how to do comparative statics with **implicit function theorem**. Additionally, we proved the **envelope theorem** and its economic intuition.
